# 📒 Contact Book (CLI Based)

A simple **Command Line Interface (CLI) Contact Book** built using **Python + SQLite**.  
This project focuses on strengthening **Python fundamentals**, **SQL basics**, and **problem-solving** through real CRUD operations.

> Built with patience, debugging pain, and real learning — not copy-paste magic.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using **SQLite with Python**
- Writing **modular code**
- Handling database connections properly
- Debugging real errors (not tutorial ones)
- Writing cleaner functions & SQL queries
- Understanding why `.gitignore` matters

⚠️ Note About Database File

The contacts.db file is ignored intentionally using .gitignore.

👉 When you run the project, the database will be created automatically.

This is done to:

Avoid pushing personal data

Follow best GitHub practices

📌 Future Improvements

Case-insensitive search

Update contact feature

Validation for duplicate contacts

Export contacts to CSV

Better UI formatting

Building fundamentals one project at a time.

⭐ Final Note

This project is small by design —
because strong fundamentals beat flashy projects.

If you’re learning Python + SQL, try building this yourself.
